# Three browserify example
Boiler plate code to build a demo with budo and browserify, inspired by the workflow of [@mattdesl](github.com/mattdesl).

## Motivation
Three.js npm support is still very basic. Most examples found are done by including THREE through a script tag in the head. This makes it easy to easily add libraries like OrbitControl etc.
